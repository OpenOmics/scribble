## Overview
Welcome to scribble! Scribble is a collection of bioinformatics and data science guides, scripts, code snippets, and oneliners. At the end of the day, we code to decipher the code of life. Did you write an awesome oneliner to that became sentient? Scribble it down before its lost forever!

To contribute to scribble, please create a new directory:
  
1. Add a README.md containing basic information about the script or code snippet
    - If your code replies on any third party software or packages, please add a list of the required dependencies.  
2. Lint your scripts, code-snippets, or config files and make changes as needed (optional, but recommended). Google maintains a [set of style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for diffferent programming languages. These are best practices developers/teams at Google follow. We don't enforce their recommendations; however, I would recommend reading through the sytle guides for python, R, and shell scripts at least once. There is a lot of great information in each of these guides!
    - `bash/sh`: [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
    - `python`: [flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8), [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [black](https://black.vercel.app/)
    - `R`: [lintr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/readme/README.html)
    - `JSON`: [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/)
    - `YAML`: [yamllint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
3. Upload any relevant files, scripts, or code snippets.
    - Please take some time to ensure you scripts or code snippets do ***not*** contain any hardcoded paths.
