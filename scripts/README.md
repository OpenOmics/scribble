# Scripts

The scripts directory contains generalized scripts that accomplish a task, analysis, or objective. Did you write an awesome script that automates something cool? Did you create a script that produces a beautiful figure? Scribble it down here! If your script contains a few small input files (<200KB), please feel free to include them here as well. Scripts don't have to be written in python and R to be useful. Rmarkdown, quarto, jupyter notebooks, and even simple bash/sh scripts are all welcome! Please take some steps to ensure your scripts do not contain any hard-coded paths to files or resources. If your script has software requirements, please list them in the README accompanying your script. 

Please do not include any rendered Rmarkdown reports here -- these files are much larger than you think since their resources are embedded!
