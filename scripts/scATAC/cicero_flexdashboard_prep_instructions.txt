To be used with convert_conns_into_cleaned-bedpe.R and cicero_filtering_shiny.Rmd.

Please note that the flex dashboard can be adapted to work with other bedpe data without too much difficulty.

These notes assume you are using the most up to date versions of the packages available
as of January 2023.

The example uses code specific to hg38, but can be adapted to any standard reference.

Step1: Run cicero on your signac object data

  Note: The default cicero conditions are ideal for human samples and should not be
  changed. All other species will require tweaking, see cicero documentation.

 if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github('satijalab/seurat-wrappers')
  remotes::install_github("cole-trapnell-lab/cicero-release", ref = "monocle3")

  library(Signac)
  library(Seurat)
  library(SeuratWrappers)
  library(cicero)
  library(GenomeInfoDb)
  library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86)
  library(GenomicRanges)

  annotations <- GetGRangesFromEnsDb(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86)
  seqlevelsStyle(annotations) <- 'UCSC'
  genome(annotations) <- "hg38"
  genome.df <- data.frame(chr=names(seqlengths(annotations)),length=seqlengths(annotations))

  data.cds <- as.cell_data_set(x = data)
  data.cicero <- make_cicero_cds(data.cds, reduced_coordinates = reducedDims(data.cds)$UMAP)
  data.conns <- run_cicero(data.cicero, genomic_coords = genome.df, sample_num = 100)


Step2: Run convert_conns_into_cleaned-bedpe.R

  source("convert_conns_into_cleaned-bedpe.R")
  conns2Bedpe(conns= data.conns, RDSfile="data.RDS") 


Step 3: Adapt Rmd for your project
  Note: You will need one Rmd for each cicero analysis/RDS file.

  For all steps listed, line numbers will be those in the original file cicero_filtering_shiny.Rmd.
    1. Update the title and introductory summary for your project.
    2. Change line 158 to that of the RDS to be analyzed with this flexdashboard.
    3. Update species/reference genome specific features:
        a. Update package lists in lines 33-37.
        b. Update information in lines 41-43 to be consistent.
        c. If gene symbols are not all caps for your species, change gene2GRanges
           (lines 61-66) to handle the difference.

Step 4: Test Rmd

  Here are the basic steps:
    1. Make sure that the RDS and Rmd are in the same folder.
    2. Open the Rmd with RStudio
    3. Make sure the working directory is the location where the files are located
    4. Scroll through the file to line 23.
    5. Click the green arrow there to make sure the necessary packages are installed 
       (only need to do this once)
    6. Click the “Run Document” button at the top of the file’s window to have the 
       dashboard start running.
    7. Explore the data.
